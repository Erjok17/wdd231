            <h2>How to Create a Winning Basketball Recruiting Video</h2>
            <p>Creating a standout recruiting video is crucial to catching the attention of coaches and scouts. Follow these steps to ensure your video highlights your skills effectively:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Gather Game Footage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use only <strong>game footage</strong>—no practice or drills.</li>
                <li>Include <strong>30-40 plays</strong> that showcase your best moments.</li>
                <li>Ensure the competition level is strong to demonstrate your ability against skilled opponents.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>2. Set Up the Camera Properly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a <strong>tripod</strong> to keep the footage stable and professional.</li>
                <li>Position the camera to capture the <strong>full mid-court view</strong>—avoid obstructed angles or crowd interference.</li>
                <li>Do <strong>not zoom in and out</strong>; keep the frame wide enough to show the entire play.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>3. Highlight Key Skills</h3>
            <p>Coaches want to see a well-rounded player. Include plays that demonstrate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shooting capability:</strong> Show a variety of shots (3-pointers, mid-range, free throws).</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring ability:</strong> Highlight drives to the basket and finishing through contact.</li>
                <li><strong>Footwork and quickness:</strong> Display agility, speed, and defensive movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing at the rim:</strong> Include layups, dunks, and contested finishes.</li>
                <li><strong>All-around athleticism:</strong> Showcase rebounding, fast breaks, and hustle plays.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball handling:</strong> Demonstrate dribbling skills, crossovers, and breaking presses.</li>
                <li><strong>Blocking shots:</strong> Include defensive plays like blocks and steals.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>4. Keep It Clean and Professional</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid <strong>special effects</strong>, music, or flashy transitions. Let your skills speak for themselves.</li>
                <li>Start the video with a <strong>brief introduction</strong>: State your name, position, height, weight, and graduation year.</li>
                <li>End with your <strong>contact information</strong> (email, phone number, and social media handles).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>5. Edit and Organize</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrange plays in a logical order (e.g., scoring, defense, athleticism).</li>
                <li>Keep the video <strong>3-5 minutes long</strong>—coaches prefer concise, impactful footage.</li>
                <li>Use simple text overlays to label plays if necessary (e.g., "3-Pointer," "Fast Break Dunk").</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>6. Share Your Video</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload the video to platforms like <strong>YouTube</strong> or <strong>Vimeo</strong> for easy sharing.</li>
                <li>Share the link with coaches, recruiters, and on your social media profiles.</li>
                <li>Include the link in your player profile on recruiting websites.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>By following these guidelines, you’ll create a recruiting video that highlights your skills, impresses coaches, and opens doors to scholarships and opportunities. <strong>Your talent deserves to be seen—make it happen!</strong></p>
